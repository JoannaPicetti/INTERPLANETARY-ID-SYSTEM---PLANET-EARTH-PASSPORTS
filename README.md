I build a new wallet, like Metamask but for being a Global Citizen of Planet Earth 

Exactly, like a Metamask wallet: 

You can be Global Citizen
You can be Company 
You can be Government 

All of them proof their identity

A new Software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with Global Digital Jurisdiction of Planet Earth, It allows users (Global citizens, Private Sector, Nations) to access their wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications

But not metamask, could be -->  PLANET EARTH wallet
So, If you are a country ---> Your wallet as a Country is there, like El Salvador
So, if you are a company (start up, enterprise, etc..) ---> Your wallet as a Company is there
So, if you are an individual ---> Your wallet as a Global Citizen is there

Every transactions between the parties are transparent and we can rebuild trust in all the entire planet

I am building and architecting an Identity digital Global System --> Proof of Identity --> E-digital NTT Passports.    I was planning to write also a Proof of Concept in Ethereum Ecosystem, because ERC20/ ERC721/ ERC1155 does not serve to intransferible tokens.   If you know some tool on OZ that can help me with that please let me know.


I totally bulish to build Digital Passports worldwide, Not more MRP (Too obsolete, too much money paying the nations to that monopoly of papers to build MRP physical passports)   Another thing  ---> Is possible to connect smart contracts with the information on a chip?

Was also thinking to connect the chip information that current physical passports have with smart contract to appear all the transactions on the blockchain. So every border can track the history of the people trough the digital NTT passport. 

Main Goal:  PUT ID Digital PASSPORTS on the Blockchain —> Of course not in small one —> Think I will build GLOBAL DIGITAL JURISDICTION trough BLOCKCHAIN

Decentralize Identity - Self Sovereign Identity - Build Digital Passports in your mobile and use it at the airports just like mobile Payments.

Do you know what kind of coding payment wallets companies use it to do mobile payments. Maybe I can do a quickly test with something like that

I see, the think is: I am imaging every Nation as a DAO ---> so every Nation is a Blockchain, right? --> (Future: People can vote there, and also see transactions between 3 parties on the Blockchain : Private Sector (with their wallet) + Public Sector (with their wallet address) + Civil Society (Every people with their wallet address: DIGITAL PASSPORT as a first product)
DO you follow me?
Of course I will start with People first, but in the same reliable Global DIgital Jurisdiction I will add the ID of three parties: Nations, Companies, People
MVP: WALLET PASSPORT
